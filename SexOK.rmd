####This study deals with questions about possible relationships between views toward extramrital sex and sex, political views, and current relationship status. The data is from the 2016 general social survey.




# Sex

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method.!-->



#Polyview

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->

#Relationship Status




# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variables causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->
